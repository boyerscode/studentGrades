# studentGrades
Program that calculates a students grade and if they get an "A", they do not need to take a final. You will need to cd to the directory and enter "npm install". This assumes you have Node.js installed on your computer. Then you can enter "npm run lint" to run ESLint "install it if you don't have it (npm install eslint --save-dev)" and "npm run format" to run Prettier.
